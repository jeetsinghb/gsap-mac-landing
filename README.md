## 📝 Developer Note

This project is **not a cloned repository**.  
I built the entire application **from the ground up**, following the concepts taught in the tutorial and implementing them independently.  

Throughout the process, I gained **practical, real-world exposure** to:
- structuring React applications,
- integrating 3D models using Three.js,
- orchestrating high-performance animations with GSAP,
- and creating immersive, production-style landing pages.

This project reflects both my **hands-on learning** and my ability to apply modern front-end technologies in a professional manner.
